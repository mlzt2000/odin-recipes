        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal. You can substitute 
            the chicken with beef or pork for variety. My wife and I absolutely love this recipe, 
            and it only takes 30 minutes with very few dirty dishes! Serve over rice.</p>
